A Java client for Etherpad Lite’s HTTP JSON API. Etherpad Lite is a collaborative editor provided by the Etherpad Foundation.

See https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite for information on how to install and configure your own Etherpad Lite instance, and read http://etherpad.org/doc/v1.2.0/ for an in-depth description of Etherpad Lite’s HTTP API.

DOCUMENTATION
For now, the best documentation is reading through the methods available in the EPLiteClient class: https://raw.github.com/jhollinger/java-etherpad-lite/master/src/org/etherpad_lite_client/EPLiteClient.java. The methods are 1:1 with the EPLite API methods.

DEPENDENCIES
Depends on JSON.simple - http://code.google.com/p/json-simple/. Tested against version 1.1.1.

DOWNLOADS
You may download pre-compiled .jar files from http://jordanhollinger.com/etherpad-lite-java-client

NOTES
HEAD currently targets Etherpad Lite API v1.2.1. The plan is to keep up with the most recent version of the Etherpad Lite API. (Note that we're talking about API versions here, not release versions).

EXAMPLES

EPLiteClient client = new EPLiteClient("http://etherpad.mysite.com", "FJ7jksalksdfj83jsdflkj");

# Get pad text
String text = client.getText("my_pad").get("text").toString(); 

# Get list of all pad ids
HashMap result = client.listAllPads();
List padIds = (List) result.get("padIDs");
