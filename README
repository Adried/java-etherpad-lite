A Java client for Etherpad Lite’s HTTP JSON API. Etherpad Lite is a collaborative editor provided by the Etherpad Foundation.

See https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite for information on how to install and configure your own Etherpad Lite instance, and read https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/wiki/HTTP-API for an in-depth description of Etherpad Lite’s HTTP API.

DOCUMENTATION
For now, the best "documentation" is reading through the methods available in the EPLiteClient class: https://raw.github.com/jhollinger/java-etherpad-lite/master/org/etherpad_lite_client/EPLiteClient.java

DOWNLOADS
You may download pre-compiled .jar files from http://jordanhollinger.com/etherpad-lite-java-client

NOTES
This is beta-quality software.

This targets version 1.2 of Etherpad Lite (API version 1.1). It is mostly incompatible with version 1.0.

EXAMPLES

EPLiteClient api = new EPLiteClient("http://etherpad.mysite.com", "FJ7jksalksdfj83jsdflkj");
HashMap pad = api.getText("my_pad");
String text = pad.get("text").toString();
